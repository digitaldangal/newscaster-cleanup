## About NewsCaster Cleanup:

  NewsCaster CLEANUP was an in-house CRUD application designed to dynamically parse the NewsCaster Database, detect the folder architecture of the NewsCaster, and look for issues with the clip library such as orphaned clips. It generates a report, and gives the user the ability to delete the problem files from the system.

  I developed NewsCaster CLEANUP independently, using the powerful JavaScript technology called Electron. After this project, my JS skills were rather robust; I could set up and use Node (and its fs module), advanced ES6 techniques like async/await, and build React apps from scratch.

  Because of NC CleanUp, the NewsMaker development team was able to increase the volume of their workflow as well as identify previously unnoticed bugs in the NewsCaster Media Manager.
